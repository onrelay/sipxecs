sipXecs application to display company name from an incoming call on
the display of the phone. You can rewrite CID based DDI (DID) or DNIS
matches. CID are rewritten immediately without requiring restart to
any service and workes in High Availablity clusters.

Application include GUI component to edit mappings.

Possible Future Enhancements
===============================

* We didn't build in any number recognition logic, we might do that,
  but it's also an option to just require the number to be correct in
  the source database.

* Enhance UI to edit individual entry instead of requiring uploading
  of entire mapping
