# Welcome to the sipXecs Project!

sipXecs, aka sipXcom, is an advanced open soure IP based enterprise communication system originally developed by PingTel in the early 2000s. It has since then been developed and sponsored by a chain of commercial organizations such as Avaya, Nortel, eZuce and CoreDial. 

sipXcom is now being further developed and maintained by OnRelay, who is using sipXcom as an integral part of its cloud based mobile business phone service. This repository is a fork from the latest stable release 21.04 at https://github.com/sipXcom/sipxecs. 

Both *sipXecs* and *sipXcom* names have been used interchangably for historic reasons. At OnRelay we now use *sipXecs* to name the overall open source project and *sipXcom* to name the product, but this terminology may not be consistent across the code base and legacy documentation.

The sipXcom Documentation can be found [here](https://onrelay.github.io/sipxecs).
