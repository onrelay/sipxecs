# Welcome to the sipXecs Project!

sipXecs, aka sipXcom, is an advanced open soure IP based enterprise communication system originally developed by PingTel in the early 2000s. It has since then been developed and sponsored by a chain of commercial organizations such as Bluesocket, Avaya, Nortel, eZuce and CoreDial. 

sipXcom is now being further developed and maintained by [OnRelay](https://www.onrelay.com), who is using sipXcom as an integral part of its cloud based mobile business phone service. This repository is a fork from the latest stable release 21.04 at https://github.com/sipXcom/sipxecs. 

sipXcom documentation can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://onrelay.github.io/sipxecs">here</a>.
